This is my submission for the Github Visualization 


To run my implementation:
the device running the files will require pip install django, pip install plotly, pip install pandas,pip install Faker.( running install.sh file should install all these modules)
inside the buttonpython/script there is a file named config.py where you have to add your github token
run the run.sh and run-db.sh file inside buttonpython in two diffrent windows
the file run.sh will have the servers address 172.0.0.1:8001 which is to be opened
The homepage will have 2 search abrs the first one is supposed to have username the second one is supposed the have the months the code churn is to be performed to(only 100 commits will be extracted)
after clicking on search user a page will be displayed will all the details of the user 
on the top right in the navigation bar a "churn" will appear clicking on that will redirect to a page which will show the code churn details of the user
deletion/addtions * 100
on the top right there will be a new "compare" option visible which will show the ratio of repositories to number of branches with the size of each value depending on the size of the repository



please refer to about page to check details about hte implementation
